// Introduction to Java
/**
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in 1995. 
It was designed to be platform-independent and follows the principle of "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that Java code can be executed on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
*/

// Key Features of Java
/**
1. Object-Oriented: Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means it focuses on objects and classes, encouraging modular and reusable code.
2. Platform-Independent: Java programs can run on any platform with the help of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which converts Java bytecode into machine-specific code.
3. Simple and Familiar: Java syntax is similar to C++ and C#, making it easy for developers to learn and use.
4. Robust and Secure: Java provides features like strong memory management, exception handling, and automatic garbage collection, enhancing reliability and security.
5. Multithreaded: Java supports multithreading, allowing concurrent execution of multiple tasks, which is essential for building scalable and responsive applications.
6. Rich Standard Library: Java comes with a comprehensive standard library (Java API) that provides ready-to-use classes and methods for various tasks, such as I/O operations, networking, and data manipulation.
7. Dynamic: Java supports dynamic loading of classes, which allows classes to be loaded only when needed, improving memory usage and performance.

// Basic Concepts in Java
/**
1. Variables and Data Types: Java supports different data types such as int, double, boolean, char, and String for storing data values, and variables are used to hold these values.
2. Control Flow: Java provides control flow statements like if-else, switch-case, while, do-while, and for loops to control the flow of execution in a program.
3. Methods: Methods in Java are blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be called from other parts of the program. Java methods may or may not return a value.
4. Classes and Objects: Classes are blueprints for creating objects, which are instances of classes. Objects encapsulate data and behavior, providing a way to model real-world entities.
5. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism in Java where a class (subclass) can inherit properties and behavior from another class (superclass), facilitating code reuse and extending functionality.
6. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling flexibility and extensibility in Java programs.
7. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class), hiding the internal implementation details from the outside world.

// Advanced Java Concepts
/**
1. Exception Handling: Java provides built-in support for handling errors and exceptional conditions using try-catch blocks, enabling graceful recovery from runtime errors.
2. Generics: Generics in Java allow classes and methods to operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety, reducing the risk of runtime errors.
3. Collections Framework: Java Collections Framework provides a set of classes and interfaces for storing and manipulating collections of objects, such as lists, sets, and maps.
4. Multithreading: Java supports multithreading, allowing concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single program, which is essential for building responsive and scalable applications.
5. I/O Operations: Java provides classes and methods for performing input and output operations, such as reading from and writing to files, streams, and network sockets.
6. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): JDBC is a Java API for connecting and interacting with relational databases, enabling Java applications to access and manipulate database data.
7. Networking: Java provides classes for networking, allowing developers to create client-server applications and communicate over the network using protocols like TCP/IP and UDP.
